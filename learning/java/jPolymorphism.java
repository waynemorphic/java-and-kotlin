/*
* ---- polymorphism in java ----
* - concept that refers to performing an action in different ways
* - polymorphism in java is achieved through method overloading and method overriding
* - the two types of polymorphism are:
*   1. compile time polymorphism
*   2. runtime polymorphism
*
* -- runtime polymorphism
* - also referred to as dynamic method dispatch is a process where an overridden method is resolved at runtime
*   rather than compile time
* - an overridden method is called through a reference variable of a superclass
*
* --- upcasting
* - occurs where the reference variable of a parent class refers to the object of the child class
* ---- example of upcasting:
*       class A{
*       }
*       class B extends A{
*       }
*       A a = new B(); --> this is upcasting

/*
* ---- compile time polymorphism ----
* - programs encounter compile time polymorphism at the compilation stage
* - in compile time polymorphism, the overloading method occurs at compilation stage
* - method overloading occurs where a method has a similar name to another method within the same class
* - method overloading requires object instantiation
