/*
* ---- Interface in java ----
* - it is a blueprint of a class with static constants and abstract methods
* - used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in java
* - they can have abstract methods and variables but cannot have a method body
* - however, if they have a method body, then the method needs to have a default keyword
* - they can also have static methods
* - cannot be instantiated, just as is the case in an abstract class
*
* --- why use interface in java
*   1. for abstraction purposes
*   2. supports multiple inheritance that is not supported in class inheritance
*   3. helps achieve loose coupling
*
* --- syntax:
*   interface <interface_name>{
*   constant fields
*   abstract methods
*   }
*
* --- note
* - a class extends another class, an interface extends another interface but a class implements an interface
* */
