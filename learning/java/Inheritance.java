/*
 * ---- inheritance in java
 * - also called an IS-A relationship
 * - mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of a parent object
 * - idea is that you can create new classes built upon existing classes
 * - by inheriting from an existing class, you can re-use methods and fields of the parent class and add new methods and
 *   fields to your current class
 * - used for method overriding to achieve runtime polymorphism and for code re-usability
 * 
 * -- terms used
 * 1. class
 *      - group objects with common properties
 *      - template for creating objects
 * 
 * 2. sub-class/child class
 *      - class that inherits the other class
 *      - also referred to as derived/extended class
 * 
 * 3. super class/parent class
 *      - class where subclass/extended class inherits its features
 * 
 * 4. extends
 *      - it indicates that you are making a new class that derives from an existing class
 *      - in other words, extends means, to increase functionality
 * 
 * -- syntax
 *      class SubclassName extends SuperClassName{
 *          methods and fields
 *      }
 * 
 * -- types of class inheritance
 * 1. Single
 * 2. Multilevel
 * 3. Hierarchical
 * *** multiple class inheritance is not allowed in java ie, one class inheriting multiple classes
 *

 * ----- multilevel inheritance -----
 * - happens when there is a chain of inheritance

 * - we then initialize the class D object with the methods created for class C and D

 *      dClassInstance.bMethod();
 *      dClassInstance.cMethod();
