/*
* - methods declaration syntax is:
        public int sum (int a, int b){
            statements
        }
        where : 
            - public is an access modifier
            - int is the return type
            - sum is the name of the method
            - int a, int b are the parameters

* - some types of access modifiers include:
        - public: method is accessible by all classes
        - private: method is accessible only in classes it is defined
        - protected: method is accessible within the same package or subclasses in a different package
        - default: when none of the modifiers are used, default is used meaning method is accessible from the same package only
        
* - method overloading is the case where a method has another name as another method
*
* ----- method overriding -----
* - method overriding on the other hand occurs when a subclass has a similar method to the
*   parent class. This means that the subclass has the specific implementation of the method declared
*   in the parent class.
* - method overriding is used for runtime polymorphism
*
* -- method overriding rules
* 1. method has similar name to parent class method
* 2. method should have same parameter to parent class
* 3. there must be an inheritance

* - types of methods are:
        - predefined method
            - built-in methods ie length() and other Math methods
        - user-defined method
            - defined accroding to the user requirements

* - static key word
*       - a method with the keyword 'static' is one that belongs to a class rather than an instance of a class
*       - its advantage is that it can be called without creating an object
*       - static methods can only access static data members

* - instance method
*       - this is a method of a class that is non-static and is defined in the class
*       - before it is called, an object of its class is first created
*           - there are two types of instance methods
*               - accessor method
*                   - this is the method that reads the instance variables. 
*                   - identifiable with the prefix word, get ie getMain
*                   - returns the value of the private field
*               - mutator method
*                   - reads the instance variables and can modify the values
*                   - identifiable with the prefix word set
*                   - does not return anything but accepts a parameter of the same data type that depends on the field
*                   - sets the value of the private field
* - abstract method
*       - it is declared in the abstract class and does not have a method body to implement it
